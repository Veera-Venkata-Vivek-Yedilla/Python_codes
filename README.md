# Python_codes

Welcome to the Python codes repository! This repository contains various Python programs demonstrating fundamental programming concepts. Each file contains codes that focus on different problems and solutions.

## Programs

1. **Find Even or Odd**  
   This program checks if a number is even or odd using conditional statements.

2. **Sum of Numbers from 1 to N**  
   This program calculates the sum of natural numbers up to a given number using loops.

3. **Sum of Odd Numbers from 1 to N**  
   This program calculates the sum of odd numbers up to a given number using loops and conditional statements.

4. **Factorial of a Number**  
   This program computes the factorial of a given number using loops (e.g., `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1`).

5. **Fibonacci Series**  
   This program generates the Fibonacci series up to a certain number, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (e.g., `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`).

6. **Palindrome Check**  
   This program determines if a string or number reads the same backward as forward (e.g., `"madam"` or `121`).

7. **Reverse a String**  
   This program reverses a given string using loops or slicing (e.g., `"hello"` becomes `"olleh"`).

8. **Reverse a Number**  
   This program reverses a given number using loops or mathematical operations (e.g., `12345` becomes `54321`).

9. **Prime Numbers**  
   This program checks if a number is prime, meaning it has no divisors other than `1` and itself.

10. **Armstrong Number**  
    This program verifies if a number is an Armstrong number, where the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits equals the number itself (e.g., `153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3`).

11. **Leap Year Check**  
    This program determines if a year is a leap year, which occurs every 4 years, except for years that are multiples of `100` and not multiples of `400`.
